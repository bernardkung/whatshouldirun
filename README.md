# What Should I Run?

Filterable loot table for World of Warcraft. Figure out which dungeons have the drop that fits your item slot and spec. Like Droptimizer, but dumber.





# Notes
Move dungeons to a State, which would be a list of dicts with dungeon_name, dungeon_code, and loot_table. This should allow sorting by length of loot_table.
